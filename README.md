## 🔎 Project Overview

This project aims to guide developers through the process of building and deploying a production-ready web application using the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, commonly used to serve Django applications in production.
- **Nginx**: A high-performance web server and reverse proxy server, often used to handle static files, SSL termination, and as a load balancer.

The guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the project locally and deploying it in a production environment with emphasis on security, traffic handling, and monitoring.
